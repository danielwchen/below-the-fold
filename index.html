    <div id="title">How the "Fold" Dictates News Story Structure</div><br>
    <div id="body-text">


        <p>
            Very few readers of a news article make it to the end. Some bounce immediately. A <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html">Slate article</a> states that 38% leave without engagement on their pages. Of those who stay, most don't even make it to the halfway point. This page uses data from <a href="http://blog.chartbeat.com/2013/08/12/scroll-behavior-across-the-web/">Josh Schwartz's blogpost on Chartbeat</a> to illustrate how readers would interact with an online article.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important information in an article should be given closer to the top of the page than the bottom. In journalism, this structure of writing is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)">the inverted pyramid</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="img/invertedpyramid.png" width="70%">
        <p>
            In this chart, the width represents the importance of the content. The lead is the most important because it reveals the style and content of the entire article, which lets readers decide whether or not to continue. The nut graph is a paragraph that summarizes the most important points of the story and gives the immediate impact. The rest of the article contains the context and further information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In print media, the fold referred to the real, well, <i>fold</i> of the page. <i>Above the fold</i> referred to upper part of the front page that is immediately visible without picking up the newspaper. To maximize newspaper sales, editors place the most important, most interesting headlines above the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in the front page of the New York Times on March 13, 2017, the stories "Russia Fills Dossiers From Hacker's Troves" and "Economic Steam Pits Trump Goal Against Wary Fed" make it above the fold. Two more headlines hover right along the fold.
        </p>
        <img src="img/nytimesfold.jpg" width="50%">
        <p>
            Though online media no longer have a physical <i>fold</i>, the user tendency to stop reading means that it is still desirable to place the most important information at the top of a page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>The fold</i> is still used in digital media, but it instead refers to the last point of the page that can be seen by the user without scrolling. Something unusual happens in digital media.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Atlantic, for example, starts its articles with a large image that takes up the entire page. The Washington Post and The New York Times both start most of their articles with an ad at the top, then the headline, and then a multimedia item. 
        </p>
        <img src="img/abovethefold.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>
            In fact, for most major media sites, the body of the content does not start until <i>below</i> the fold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, unlike in print media, which puts content above the fold in order to increase visibility while reducing the amount of work a potential reader puts in, in the digital format, user input is required to begin reading. Why would digital formats diverge from the wisdom of print media?
        </p>
        <p>
            This format, too, takes cues from reader behavior. About 30% of users begin scrolling before the page has finished loading, which means that they never see the top of the page. Starting the text lower in the page actually increases its readibility. In fact, the maximum

            Does this 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, the structure of a news story is still dictated by readers' tendencies to drop stories early.
        </p>

            As you can see, the background of this page represents the percent of people who see each part of the page. The data is borrowed from
